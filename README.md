# Project 3 proved to be very challenging. The 4 programs each have separate tasks. The first checks for suspicious behavior, while the following programs check for irresponsible behavior, system glitches, and domain count in that order.
# I had trouble sorting the data by user, originally I tried using pandas but that didnt work. Finally I was able to figure it out with far less code than i imagined by using a regex.
# The second and third parts were very similar but both difficult, originally I was stuck, but I figured out I was able to make a counter and get the glitch and irresponsible counts that way.
# Finally I had trouble getting the name and Email-ID separated but I was able to use a simple split() functin to fix it.
